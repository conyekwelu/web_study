Atom makes creating a bare bones html doc easy - just type html and hit enter
(automatically creates html, head, title and body tags)

<!-- Can also use shortcut ctrl /  -->

<> content </> = element
(a tag and the content it encircles is called an element e.g. h1 element)
exceptions include <img>

to add style, add a style element to the head section under title

elements have attributes e.g. style has attribute "type"

Information about the Web page goes into the <head> element.
What you put into the <body> element is what you see in the browser.




HTML - structure
CSS - presentation

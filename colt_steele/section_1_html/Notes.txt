Atom makes creating a bare bones html doc easy - just type html and hit enter
(automatically creates html, head, title and body tags)

<!-- Can also use shortcut ctrl /  -->

<> content </> = element
(a tag and the content it encircles is called an element e.g. h1 element)
exceptions include <img>
to add style, add a style element to the head section under title
elements have attributes e.g. style has attribute "type"
Information about the Web page goes into the <head> element.
What you put into the <body> element is what you see in the browser.

HTML - structure
CSS - presentation
JS - Interaction

h1 - h6, p are block level element
strong & em - bold and emphasis/italics
use lorem ipsum generator for design
use <div>'s as container for holding a group of stuff - block
use <span>'s as container for holding a group of stuff - inline
form tag is just a container for all the inputs
forms have two important attributes:
- action (where form sends data to - usually your backend/server)
- method (GET or POST)
GET (retrieves Information) vs POST (updates database) request
other form input attributes: name, placeholder, required, type
//button at end of form or input type = submit

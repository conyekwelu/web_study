# Ideas

I have two ideas for my summer paper. 

**Theoretical Model**

The first idea involves looking at why prizes jump. It involves looking critically at the Burgsthaler-Dichev (1997) model and any subsequent models, and then to try and expand it. The basic idea is that investors always juggle their beliefs between thinking a company is valued at its adaptation value, or its recursion value. Hence, if the economy is good, for some reasons, Investors are more likely to believe that the recursion value is the true value while if bad investors are more likely to believe that the adaptation value is a true value. And for smoothness, I can put some kind of weighting in between them, which is some probability that investors believe that the true value is the adaptation value recursion value. So:


$$
\begin {gather}
Pr(Adaptation Value) = \alpha \\
Pr(Recursion Value) = 1 - \alpha \\
Firm Value = \alpha(Adaptation Value) + (1 - \alpha)(RecursionValue)
\end {gather}
$$


It is important then to investigate what influences alpha. What kinds of information shocks or cross-sectional variations affect alpha?

Alpha is a function of the persistence of a company's business technology. So if the investors believe that the company's business technology is not going to last either through obsolescence competition, then they will update their beliefs about alpha. 

alpha declines as investors beliefs about the likelihood obsolescence of the technology go up.

**Hence, my first idea is to investigate what drives alpha. How does alpha respond to information shocks?**



The second idea has to do with anomalies from the original Burgsthaler - Dichev model. Firms with negative earnings have a negative coefficient on earnings when you regress earnings on market values (Negative ERC)

Historically, earnings have positive ERCs and so the question is these firms that have negative ERCs, why Do they have it? In order to investigate this properly, I need to read the Collins paper, where they attempt to do a first dive into it and show that the coefficient on earnings is more negative for firms that are more likely to go bankrupt. 

I think beyond that on can extend our literature to show that there's two types of firms with negative earnings - growth firms and mature firms. Could investors systemically underprice price losses and so undervalue both types of firms similarly?

Secondly, there's cross sectional variation in in adaptation costs and adaptation values that have not been exploited. And so, you know, I expect that for an industry like pharmaceuticals, or any industry with a higher level of intangible assets, the adaptation values shouldn't be significant and the adaptation costs should be much higher than the average industry levels. 

**And so I expect to see a difference in industry levels - lower values and higher costs**. And this analysis will feed into Asset Pricing Tests to understand how how investors valued us firms with these effects

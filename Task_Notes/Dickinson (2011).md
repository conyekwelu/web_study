### Purpose:

To develop and validate a proxy for a firm's life cycle using its cash flow patterns and predicted behaviour across different life cycle stages

### Tension:

Capturing life cycle at the firm level instead of the product or industry level is difficult due to diversity of firms and their multi-product nature

Previously, firm life cycle had been assessed using performance measure and firm characteristics including age, size and profitability. The problem with sorting by these measures are two fold:

- assumes a uniform distribution
- they vary non-linearly with firms' life cycle

### Mapping:

*This mapping results in 8 posible life cycle categories depending on the sign of each of the cash flow types*

### Conclusion:

Mapping cash flows to economic theory provides a better predictor of a firm's life cycle than previous measures. 

Investors do not efficiently price mature firms resulting in excess one year buy and hold returns of 1.6%

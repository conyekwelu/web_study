# Tasks for Today - 13 Aug 2019

### Update Status on Math BootCamp (Start 12:50pm - End 02:00pm)

- [x] Send out Week 11 notes for the Math Boot Camp
- [x] Send out Tentative September Schedule
- [x] Grade Week 10 submissions for the Math Boot Camp

Took longer than planned - finished at 2:20 due to distractions



### Launch School Programming (Start 3:50pm - 5:00pm)

- [x] Redo Lesson 3
- [x] Redo Lesson 4



### Element Assignment

String.chars => returns an array of every character

String.split(delimiter) => returns array of characters split by the delimiter

Array.join => combines the characters into a string

Array.to_h <=> Hash.to_a

String element assignment is destructive

Array element assignment is destructive

### Looping

Four main elements - loop, counter, a way to retrieve current value, a way to exit the loop

### PEDAC

**Key:** If you can't write a plain English solution to the problem, you won't be able to code it either.

P - Understand the Problem

- read problem description
- check test cases
- clarify any unclear matter [return same object? input types? ]

**Output of P** = input type, output type and if same object, explicit and implicit requirements

E - Examples / Test Cases

D - Data Structure &  A - Algorithm

- data structure depends on output e.g. array

- algorithm looks like a pseudo-code e.g:

  ![1565745923384](C:\Users\Chijioke Onyekwelu\Documents\webdevbootcamp\Task_Notes\algorithm.png)

above is incomplete as line 6 represents a complex function which needs to be built, as well as a function find ALL the substrings. A more detailed version:

C - Code

Complete pseudocode as below before actual code is written:

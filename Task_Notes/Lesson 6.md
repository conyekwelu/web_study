# Lesson 6

### steps to working on more complicated programs:

- breakdown into smaller pieces
- map out flow (preferably with flow chart) with sub-processes
- write out pseudo-code for each sub-process [clear inputs and outputs]
- use `pry` to debug



### Debugging

identify the problem from the error message

understand why it is a problem

implement solution

### Error Types

syntax errors - programming language does not recognize, will throw up exception

logical errors - code will run but not produce the result you want



### Pry

initiate by putting `require 'pry'` at the top of your file

call by putting `binding.pry` at the point to debug

can access variables eg array using `cd array`

type `ls` like in linux to see the methods available to that variable

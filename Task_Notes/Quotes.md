“It is only the attempt to write down your ideas that enables them to develop.” –Wittgenstein (pg 109, [*Recollections of Wittgenstein*](http://www.amazon.com/Recollections-Wittgenstein-Hermine/dp/0192876287/?tag=gwernnet-20)); “I thought a little [while in the isolation tank], and then I stopped thinking altogether…incredible how idleness of body leads to idleness of mind.

Owing to this habit, very few objections were raised against my views which I had not at least noticed and attempted to answer.

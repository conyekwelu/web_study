# Hayn (1995)

### Purpose

to show that losses are more weakly associated with returns than profits and that this is another plausible reason why the relationship between returns and earnings is weak. 

the intuition is that losses are likely to be temporary (transitory) as shareholders are more likely to liquidate a non-performing firm than suffer from indefinite losses (equity ownership as a put option on the future cash flows)

### Tension

previous literature has suggested other possible reasons for the weak return - earnings relation (documented in Bernard 1989, Lev 1989) including:

- earnings not reflecting underlying economics timely enough (Beaver, Lambert and Morse 1980)
- earnings contain value - irrelevant transitory components (Givoly and Hayn 1993 amongst others)
- cross-sectional tests do not recognize intrinsic time-series properties of individual firm earnings (Komendi and Lipe 1987)
- levels vs changes specification matters (Kothari 1992)

### Conclusion / Contribution

losses dampen the relation between returns and earnings. 

it is all about the signal about future earnings -> if future earnings are predicted to be sufficiently low then the liquidation option is attractive

# Hayn (1995)

### Purpose

to assess the effect of loss cases on the return-earnings relation and it's cross-sectional and inter-temporal variation

to show that losses are more weakly associated with returns than profits and that this is another plausible reason why the relationship between returns and earnings is weak. 

the intuition is that losses are likely to be temporary (transitory) as shareholders are more likely to liquidate a non-performing firm than suffer from indefinite losses (equity ownership as a put option on the future cash flows)

**Jay Ritter (1991**)

### Tension

previous literature has suggested other possible reasons for the weak return - earnings relation (documented in Bernard 1989, Lev 1989) including:

- earnings not reflecting underlying economics timely enough (Beaver, Lambert and Morse 1980)
- earnings contain value - irrelevant transitory components (Givoly and Hayn 1993 amongst others)
- cross-sectional tests do not recognize intrinsic time-series properties of individual firm earnings (Komendi and Lipe 1987)
- levels vs changes specification matters (Kothari 1992)

### Conclusion / Contribution

losses dampen the relation between returns and earnings. 

exclusing loss cases triples the one year ERC and explanatory power of earnings

when looking at only loss cases, no correlation between reported losses and prices (could it be she suggests because losses are extreme realizations from the earnings distribution and behave as a mean - reverting process)

it is all about the signal about future earnings -> if future earnings are predicted to be sufficiently low then the liquidation option is attractive

### Testing

Compustat sample with returns taken from CRSP

##### General form of test

$$
R_t = \alpha + \beta X_t/P_{t-1} + \epsilon_t
$$

##### Expected results

$$
ERC(R^2)_{losses} < ERC(R^2)_{full-sample} < ERC(R^2)_{profits}
$$

**where:** R is the contemporaneous return (measured over twelve months from year end t-1), X is compustat IBC

Xt is truncated at the top and bottom 1% of the distribution (note 11)

when using pooled sample, loss-firm year if loss in year t or t-1

##### Cross- Sectional / Robustness

- general test but use cumulated variables over 2 - 10 years

- test association between frequency of losses and decline in ERC
  $$
  ERC_t \: or \: RSQ_t = \delta_0 + \delta_1FREQ_t + \omega_t
  $$
  
- test the effect of mean reversion. i.e. if mean reversion then:
  $$
  ERC(R^2)_{losses} = ERC(R^2)_{equally \ extreme \ profit \ sample}
  $$
  clever test that measures extremeties in number of standard deviations: for each firm year divide deviation from firm mean profit by the firm standard deviation.

- interact equation (1) with likelihood of exercising liquidation option

##### Interesting results

- ERCs and R-squared decline monotonically with the number of firm years in which a particular firm experiences a loss
- ERC and R-squared for loss firms approximately zero
- 





### Open Questions: 

- related to BD 1997 why is there an assumtion that value is the higher of recursion value/E[ pv cash flows ] and abandonments/adaptation value? expectation by definition harbours uncertainty is this not against conservatism? is this related to ergodic theory?
- negstive book vslue is about recursion value
- why has there been a drop in the ERC over the last 40 years (as at 1995)? 
- do shareholders infact have a liquidation option as proposed in Hayn (1995) or is it managers that have a liquidation option BD (1997) - i presume this effect will vary by the power of the shareholders relative to managers e.g. in states with more shareholder rights, founder - controlled firms etc
- on pg. 140 Hayn suggests that losses represent extreme observations of the earnings level distribution. this is intuitive if we also consider that accounting profits are upwardly biased in comparison to economic profits. How do we then make sense of numbers in 2015 where loss firms are greater than profit firms.

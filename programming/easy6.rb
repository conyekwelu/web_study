# Cute angles
#
# Write a method that
# takes a floating point number that represents an angle between 0 and 360 degrees
#  returns a String that represents that angle in degrees, minutes and seconds.
#
#  You should use a degree symbol (°) to represent degrees, a single quote (') to represent minutes, and a double quote (") to represent seconds. A degree has 60 minutes, while a minute has 60 seconds.

DEGREE = "\xC2\xB0"

# input - floating point number between 0 and 360
# output - string representation of angle in degrees, minutes, second
#
# data structure - numeric
# algorithm
# select the digits before the decimal point
# store in a variable as degrees
# select the decimal portion of the number
# multiply it by 60 to convert to minutes
# if answer still has decimal
#   select the digits before decimal and store it as minutes
#   multiply the decimal portion by 60 to convert it to seconds
#
# combine the degrees, minutes and seconds in required format

Atom makes creating a bare bones html doc easy - just type html and hit enter
(automatically creates html, head, title and body tags)

<!-- Can also use shortcut ctrl /  -->

<> content </> = element
(a tag and the content it encircles is called an element e.g. h1 element)
exceptions include <img>

to add style, add a style element to the head section under title

elements have attributes used to customize them e.g.
- style has attribute type="text/css"
- a has href attribute which allows you specify link destination
- img has src attribute which specifies picture file name (and location)

attributes come in name="value" pairs

Information about the Web page goes into the <head> element.
What you put into the <body> element is what you see in the browser.

File Organization (optimize simple and flexible/scalable)
- Root Folder -> contains homepage.html
- Images Folder -> contains images
- Category Folders -> contains html for other categories
[use ../ to go up use folder/file.html to go down]

Page Design
- sketch
- outline and structure [blocks then inline]
- write HTML

use q or blockquote to emphasize quotations (can nest <p> within blockquote)
q is an inline element while blockquote is a block element [line break pre & post]
use <code> to display code in browser
<address> -> tells browser the content is an address
<strong> -> bold emphasis, extra strength
<pre> -> show text exactly as typed
<em> -> emphasize text with italics
<hr> -> horizontal line between sections


empty elements:
- <br> = line breaks
- <img> = image

put each list item in an <li> tag, enclose all in <ol> or <ul>

HTML - structure
CSS - presentation

Better linking
- concise labels
- meaningful labels
- not next to each other

Creating anchor to section
- create anchor destination (e.g. anchor tab with id="chai")
- create anchor link to destination (href="index.html#chai")
- open anchor destination in new page (target="_blank")
# note users prefer to control when a new page opens

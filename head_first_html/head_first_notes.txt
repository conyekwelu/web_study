Atom makes creating a bare bones html doc easy - just type html and hit enter
(automatically creates html, head, title and body tags)

<!-- Can also use shortcut ctrl /  -->

<> content </> = element
(a tag and the content it encircles is called an element e.g. h1 element)
exceptions include <img>

to add style, add a style element to the head section under title

elements have attributes used to customize them e.g.

style has attribute "type"

a has href attribute which allows you specify link destination

img has src attribute which specifies picture file name (and location)

attributes come in name="value" pairs

Information about the Web page goes into the <head> element.
What you put into the <body> element is what you see in the browser.

File Organization (optimize simple and flexible/scalable)

- Images Folder -> contains images
- Category Folders -> contains html for other categories
[use ../ to go up use folder/file.html to go down]
